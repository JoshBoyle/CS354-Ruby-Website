            <h2>Description and History</h2>

            <p> Ruby is an open-source, interpreted, dynamic, high-level language.
                It markets itself as natural simple, and easy to read. </p>

            <p>Released in 1995, Ruby was developed by japansese hacker Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto.
                Matsumoto's goal was to create an easy scripting language with Object Oriented
                programming patterns and had great practicality.</p>

            <p>To achieve this vision, he combined aspects of Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and
                Lisp, to create his vision had functional and imperative programming aspects.</p>

            <p>This gave the language some very unique features.</p>

            <ul>

                <li> For instance all parts of the langauge down to the primitives are treated as objects. </li>

                <li> Its flexibility enables the developer to completely rewrite fundamental operations such as + </li>

                <li> Its "blocks" allow the user to replicate lisp functions </li> </ul>

            <p>By 2005 Ruby became a highly dominant language largely because of Ruby on Rails.</p>

            <h3>Hello World</h2>

            <p>Ruby's world is incredibly simple moreso than even python.</p>
            <p>Simply putting the following will print the famous Hello World on a terminal</p>

            <div id="hello-world" class="code-block">
                puts 'Hello world'
            </div>

            <p>Running ruby ehll</p>

            <div id="run-hello-world" class="code-block">
                puts 'Hello world'
            </div>

            <p>One unique feature of the language is that everything is an object in Ruby. </p>

            <p>This includes the langauge's primitives.</p>

            <p>Here is a snippet of code from the <a

               that demonstrates this.

                5.times { print "We *love* Ruby -- it's outrageous!" }
