                <h2>Description and History</h2>

                <p> Ruby is an open-source, interpreted, dynamic, high-level language.
                    It markets itself as natural simple, and easy to read. </p>

                <p>Released in 1995, Ruby was developed by japansese hacker Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto.
                    Matsumoto's goal was to create an easy scripting language with Object Oriented
                    programming patterns and had great practicality.</p>

                <p>To achieve this vision, he combined aspects of Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and
                    Lisp, to create his vision had functional and imperative programming aspects.</p>

                <p>This gave the language some very unique features.</p>

                <ul>

                    <li> For instance all parts of the langauge down to the primitives are treated as objects. </li>

                    <li> Its flexibility enables the developer to completely rewrite fundamental operations such as + </li>

                    <li> Its "blocks" allow the user to replicate lisp functions </li> </ul>

                <p>By 2005 Ruby became a highly dominant language largely because of Ruby on Rails.</p>

                <h3>Hello World</h3>

                <p>Ruby's hello world is incredibly simple, moreso than even python.</p>
                <p>Simply putting the following will print the famous "Hello World" on the terminal</p>

                <p id="hello-world" class="code-block">puts 'Hello world'</p>

                <h3>We Really Love Ruby</h3>

                <p>One unique feature of the language is that everything is an object in Ruby. </p>

                <p>This includes the langauge's primitives.</p>

                <p>Here is a snippet of code from the <a
                href=""https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/">about ruby</a>
                that demonstrates this.

                    5.times { print "We *love* Ruby -- it's outrageous!" }
