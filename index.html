            <p> Ruby is an open-source, interpreted, dynamic, high-level language.
                It markets itself as natural simple, and easy to read. </p>

            <p>Released in 1995, Ruby was developed by japansese hacker Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto.
                Matsumoto's goal was to create an easy scripting language with Object Oriented
                programming patterns and had great practicality.</p>

            <p>To achieve this vision, he combined aspects of Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and
                Lisp, to create his vision had functional and imperative programming aspects.</p>

            <p>This gave the language some very unique features.</p>

            <ul>

                <li> For instance all parts of the langauge down to the primitives are treated as objects. </li>

                <li> Its flexibility enables the developer to completely rewrite fundamental operations such as + </li>

                <li> Its "blocks" allow the user to replicate lisp functions </li> </ul>

            <p>By 2005 Ruby became a highly dominant language largely because of Ruby on Rails.</p>
